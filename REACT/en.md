## Smart Tricks & Methods

### Trick 1: Identify Opening Sentence
**Opening sentence usually:**
- Introduces a topic (no pronouns referring to previous context)
- Makes a general statement
- Doesn't start with "However," "Therefore," "Thus"

### Trick 3: Look for Pronouns
Pronouns (he, she, it, they, this, that, these, those) refer to nouns in previous sentences.

**Example:**
A. "John bought a car."
B. "It was red in color."

B must come after A because "It" refers to "car."

---

### Trick 4: Chronological/Time Markers
- First, Second, Third
- Initially, Then, Finally
- Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow
- In the past, Currently, In the future

---

### Trick 5: Logical Connectors
**Cause-Effect:**
- Sentence with cause → Sentence with "therefore," "thus," "hence"

**Contrast:**
- Positive statement → "However," "But," "Nevertheless"

**Addition:**
- Statement → "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally"

---

### Trick 6: Mandatory Pairs
Some sentences must come together:

**Example:**
A. "Many scientists disagree."
B. "Some argue it's beneficial."

These form a pair (contrasting views).

---

## Step-by-Step Solving Method

**STEP 1:** Read all sentences quickly
**STEP 2:** Identify opening sentence (introduces topic, no backward reference)
**STEP 3:** Identify closing sentence (conclusion, summary)
**STEP 4:** Look for mandatory pairs (pronoun references, connectors)
**STEP 5:** Check logical flow (cause-effect, time sequence)
**STEP 6:** Verify your answer by reading the complete paragraph

✓ **Solution:** Circle all pronouns and find what they refer to

❌ **Mistake 2:** Ignoring connector words
✓ **Solution:** Highlight connectors (however, therefore, moreover)

❌ **Mistake 3:** Not checking the final flow
✓ **Solution:** Always read your answer as a complete paragraph

❌ **Mistake 4:** Forcing time-based order when logic is different
✓ **Solution:** Consider cause-effect, problem-solution patterns too

✓ **Practice Pattern:** Start with fixed-sentence questions (easier)
✓ **Elimination:** If confused between 2 options, check which flows better
✓ **Read Aloud:** Mentally read your answer to check flow

- Dead, Impossible, Absolute, Infinite, Complete

---

### Trick 6: Comparing Two vs. More Than Two
- **Two things:** Use comparative + "of the two"

---

### Trick 3: Pronoun Connection
Track what pronouns refer to:

---

### Trick 4: Connector Words

**Sequence Connectors:**
- First, Second, Third
- Initially, Subsequently, Finally
- Before, After, Then, Next

**Cause-Effect:**

**Contrast:**
- However, But, Nevertheless, Yet (contrasting idea follows)

**Addition:**
- Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally, Also (additional point follows)

---

### Trick 5: Time Markers
Look for time references:

**Example:**
- "In 2020..." → "The following year..." → "Currently..."

---

### Trick 6: Link Words
Look for words that must follow specific information:

**Examples:**
- "Such" → Must follow examples
- "This method" → Must follow mention of a method
- "These problems" → Must follow mention of problems

---

## Step-by-Step Approach

**STEP 1:** Quickly read all sentences
**STEP 2:** Identify topic/theme
**STEP 3:** Find opening sentence (introduces topic, no backward reference)
**STEP 4:** Find closing sentence (conclusion, summary)
**STEP 5:** Look for mandatory pairs (pronoun references, connectors)
**STEP 6:** Arrange middle sentences logically
**STEP 7:** Read complete paragraph to verify flow

## Common Grammatical Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Dangling Modifiers

---

---

### Pitfall 5: That vs. Which
**That** = restrictive (essential information, no comma)

"The car, which is red, is mine." (adds extra info)
