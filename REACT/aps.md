**EASY Example 2**: Find L.C.M. of 4 and 6

**Solution**:
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24...
**L.C.M. = 12**

---

**MODERATE Example 3**: Find H.C.F. and L.C.M. of 24, 36, and 48

**Solution using Prime Factorization**:
- 24 = 2³ × 3¹
- 36 = 2² × 3²
- 48 = 2⁴ × 3¹

**H.C.F.** = Product of lowest powers = 2² × 3¹ = **12**
**L.C.M.** = Product of highest powers = 2⁴ × 3² = **144**

---

**MODERATE Example 4**: The H.C.F. of two numbers is 12 and their L.C.M. is 180. If one number is 36, find the other.

**Solution**:
Using formula: a × b = H.C.F. × L.C.M.
36 × b = 12 × 180
b = (12 × 180) / 36
b = **60**

---

**HARD Example 5**: Find the greatest number that divides 285, 333, and 399, leaving remainders 3, 5, and 7 respectively.

**Solution**:
The required number divides (285-3), (333-5), and (399-7) exactly.
So we need H.C.F. of 282, 328, and 392

282 = 2 × 3 × 47
328 = 2³ × 41
392 = 2³ × 7²

**H.C.F. = 2**

Wait, let me recalculate:
282 = 2 × 141 = 2 × 3 × 47
328 = 8 × 41
392 = 8 × 49

H.C.F.(282, 328) = 2
H.C.F.(2, 392) = 2
**Answer = 2**

Actually, let me verify by division method:
H.C.F.(282, 328, 392) = **2**

---

**HARD Example 6**: Six bells commence tolling together and toll at intervals of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 seconds. In 30 minutes, how many times do they toll together?

**Solution**:
L.C.M.(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) = 120 seconds

They toll together every 120 seconds.
30 minutes = 1800 seconds
Number of times = 1800/120 = 15

Adding the first toll at 0 seconds = 15 + 1 = **16 times**

### Short Tricks & Smart Methods

**Trick 1**: For H.C.F. of fractions = H.C.F. of numerators / L.C.M. of denominators

**Trick 2**: For L.C.M. of fractions = L.C.M. of numerators / H.C.F. of denominators

**Trick 3**: H.C.F. is always ≤ smallest number; L.C.M. is always ≥ largest number

**Trick 4**: For co-prime numbers (H.C.F. = 1), L.C.M. = Product of numbers

**Trick 5**: Quick L.C.M. for two numbers:
If one number is a multiple of another, the larger number is the L.C.M.

**Trick 6**: Division method for H.C.F. (faster than factorization):
- Divide larger by smaller
- Replace larger with remainder
- Repeat until remainder = 0
- Last divisor is H.C.F.

### Practice Questions with Answers

**Answer**: 9720 [L.C.M.(12,15,20,27) = 540; 9999÷540 = 18 remainder 279; So 9999-279 = 9720]

**Q8.** Find the least number which when divided by 12, 15, 20, and 54 leaves a remainder of 8 in each case.
**Answer**: 548 [L.C.M.(12,15,20,54) = 540; Add remainder: 540+8 = 548]

### Common Mistakes & Exam Tips

**Mistakes to Avoid**:
1. Confusing H.C.F. and L.C.M. (Remember: H is Highest but gives smaller answer; L is Lowest but gives larger answer)
2. Forgetting to add 1 to the count when bells/lights toll together
3. Not subtracting remainder before finding H.C.F. in "leaves remainder" questions
4. Mixing up formulas for fractions

**Exam Tips**:
1. Always verify: H.C.F. ≤ smallest number and L.C.M. ≥ largest number
2. For time-saving, use division method for H.C.F. instead of factorization
3. In word problems, identify whether you need H.C.F. (common divisor) or L.C.M. (common multiple)
4. Check divisibility rules before attempting division
5. For 2 numbers, quick check: Does H.C.F. × L.C.M. = Product of numbers?

3. **Successive Changes**: If two changes are a% and b%, 
   Net change = a + b + (ab/100)%

**AVERAGE:**
- Average = Sum of all values / Number of values
- Sum = Average × Number of values

**Special Averages**:
- Average of first n natural numbers = (n+1)/2
- Average of first n even numbers = (n+1)
- Average of first n odd numbers = n
- Average of consecutive numbers = (First + Last)/2

### Solved Examples - PERCENTAGE

**EASY Example 1**: Convert 3/5 to percentage.

**Solution**:
3/5 × 100 = 60%
**Answer: 60%**

---

**EASY Example 2**: Find 20% of 450.

**Solution**:
20% of 450 = (20/100) × 450 = 90
**Answer: 90**

---

**MODERATE Example 3**: The price of a shirt is increased by 25%. By what percentage should the new price be reduced to bring it back to the original price?

**Solution**:
Let original price = 100
After 25% increase = 125

To reduce 125 to 100:
Decrease = 25
Percentage decrease = (25/125) × 100 = 20%
**Answer: 20%**

---

**MODERATE Example 4**: A's salary is 30% more than B's salary. By what percent is B's salary less than A's salary?

**Solution**:
Let B's salary = 100
A's salary = 130

Difference = 30
B's salary is less by = (30/130) × 100 = 23.07%
**Answer: 23.07% or 23 1/13%**

---

**HARD Example 5**: The population of a town is 1,76,400. It increases by 5% in the first year and decreases by 4% in the second year. What is the population after 2 years?

**Solution**:
Using successive percentage formula:
Net change = 5 + (-4) + [5×(-4)]/100
= 5 - 4 - 0.2 = 0.8%

Population after 2 years = 176400 × (100.8/100)
= 176400 × 1.008 = 177,811.2
**Answer: 1,77,811** (approximately)

Alternative method:
After 1st year = 176400 × 1.05 = 185,220
After 2nd year = 185220 × 0.96 = 177,811.2

---

**HARD Example 6**: In an exam, 60% students passed in Math, 65% passed in English, and 45% passed in both. What percentage failed in both subjects?

**Solution**:
Passed in Math only = 60 - 45 = 15%
Passed in English only = 65 - 45 = 20%
Passed in both = 45%

Total passed in at least one = 15 + 20 + 45 = 80%
**Failed in both = 100 - 80 = 20%**

### Solved Examples - AVERAGE

**EASY Example 7**: Find the average of 15, 25, 35, and 45.

**Solution**:
Average = (15 + 25 + 35 + 45)/4 = 120/4 = 30
**Answer: 30**

---

**MODERATE Example 8**: The average of 5 numbers is 27. If one number is excluded, the average becomes 25. Find the excluded number.

**Solution**:
Sum of 5 numbers = 27 × 5 = 135
Sum of 4 numbers = 25 × 4 = 100
Excluded number = 135 - 100 = 35
**Answer: 35**

---

**MODERATE Example 9**: A batsman has an average of 48 runs in 10 innings. How many runs should he score in the 11th innings to increase his average to 50?

**Solution**:
Total runs in 10 innings = 48 × 10 = 480
Required total for 11 innings = 50 × 11 = 550
Runs needed in 11th innings = 550 - 480 = 70
**Answer: 70 runs**

---

**HARD Example 10**: A person covers a distance at 40 km/h and returns at 60 km/h. Find the average speed for the whole journey.

**Solution**:
For same distance, average speed = (2xy)/(x+y)
= (2 × 40 × 60)/(40 + 60)
= 4800/100 = 48 km/h
**Answer: 48 km/h**

**Note**: Average speed ≠ (40+60)/2. This is a common mistake!

---

**HARD Example 11**: The average weight of 10 persons increases by 1.5 kg when one person weighing 45 kg is replaced by a new person. What is the weight of the new person?

**Solution**:
Total increase = 10 × 1.5 = 15 kg
Weight of new person = 45 + 15 = 60 kg
**Answer: 60 kg**

### Short Tricks & Smart Methods

**PERCENTAGE TRICKS:**

**Trick 1**: Quick percentage conversions:
- 1/2 = 50%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 1/4 = 25%, 1/5 = 20%
- 1/6 = 16.67%, 1/8 = 12.5%, 1/10 = 10%

**Trick 2**: To find percentage increase/decrease:
If price increases from A to B, increase% = [(B-A)/A] × 100

**Trick 3**: Successive percentage changes:
Two successive changes of +x% and -x% always result in a net decrease of (x²/100)%
Example: +10% then -10% = Net decrease of 1%

**Trick 4**: If A is x% more than B, then B is [x/(100+x)] × 100% less than A

**AVERAGE TRICKS:**

**Trick 5**: For consecutive numbers, average = Middle term
Example: Average of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 = 7

**Trick 6**: If average of n numbers is x, and we add/subtract k to each number, new average = x ± k

**Trick 7**: Average speed for two equal distances:
Average = (2 × S₁ × S₂)/(S₁ + S₂)

**Trick 8**: If n numbers have average x, and one number y is added:
New average = (nx + y)/(n+1)

### Core Concepts

**RATIO**: Comparison of two quantities of the same kind.
- Written as a:b or a/b
- Has no units

**PROPORTION**: Equality of two ratios.
- If a:b = c:d, then a:b::c:d (in proportion)
- Product of extremes = Product of means: a×d = b×c

**Key Formulas**:

1. **Componendo**: If a/b = c/d, then (a+b)/b = (c+d)/d
2. **Dividendo**: If a/b = c/d, then (a-b)/b = (c-d)/d
3. **Componendo & Dividendo**: If a/b = c/d, then (a+b)/(a-b) = (c+d)/(c-d)

**Types of Proportion**:
- **Direct**: If a increases, b increases (a/b = constant)
- **Inverse**: If a increases, b decreases (a×b = constant)

**Important Points**:
- a:b can be written as ax:bx (multiplying by same number)
- To compare ratios, make second terms equal
- Duplicate ratio of a:b is a²:b²
- Triplicate ratio of a:b is a³:b³
- Sub-duplicate ratio of a:b is √a:√b
- Sub-triplicate ratio of a:b is ∛a:∛b

### Solved Examples

**EASY Example 1**: Find the ratio of 2.5 kg to 750 grams.

**Solution**:
Convert to same units: 2.5 kg = 2500 grams
Ratio = 2500:750 = 250:75 = 50:15 = 10:3
**Answer: 10:3**

---

**EASY Example 2**: Divide ₹1200 in the ratio 3:5.

**Solution**:
Sum of ratio parts = 3 + 5 = 8
First part = (3/8) × 1200 = ₹450
Second part = (5/8) × 1200 = ₹750
**Answer: ₹450 and ₹750**

---

**MODERATE Example 3**: If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:B:C.

**Solution**:
A:B = 2:3
B:C = 4:5

Make B equal in both:
A:B = 2:3 = 8:12 (multiply by 4)
B:C = 4:5 = 12:15 (multiply by 3)

**A:B:C = 8:12:15**

---

**MODERATE Example 4**: Two numbers are in the ratio 3:4. If 8 is added to each, they become in the ratio 5:6. Find the numbers.

**Solution**:
Let numbers be 3x and 4x
After adding 8: (3x+8)/(4x+8) = 5/6
Cross multiply: 6(3x+8) = 5(4x+8)
18x + 48 = 20x + 40
2x = 8
x = 4

Numbers are 3×4 = 12 and 4×4 = 16
**Answer: 12 and 16**

---

**HARD Example 5**: The incomes of A and B are in ratio 3:4 and their expenditures are in ratio 4:5. If each saves ₹2000, find their incomes.

**Solution**:
Let incomes be 3x and 4x
Let expenditures be 4y and 5y

Savings:
3x - 4y = 2000 ...(1)
4x - 5y = 2000 ...(2)

From (1): 3x = 4y + 2000
From (2): 4x = 5y + 2000

Multiply (1) by 4: 12x - 16y = 8000
Multiply (2) by 3: 12x - 15y = 6000
Subtract: -y = 2000
y = -2000... This approach is getting complex.

**Alternative method**:
Let income of A = 3k, income of B = 4k
Let expenditure of A = 4m, expenditure of B = 5m

3k - 4m = 2000 ...(1)
4k - 5m = 2000 ...(2)

From (1): 3k = 4m + 2000
From (2): 4k = 5m + 2000

15k = 20m + 10000 [multiply (1) by 5]
12k = 15m + 6000 [multiply (2) by 3]

Multiply first by 3: 45k = 60m + 30000
Multiply second by 4: 48k = 60m + 24000
Subtract: -3k = 6000
k = -2000... Error in approach.

Let me reconsider:
Income A = 3x, Income B = 4x
Expenditure A = 4y, Expenditure B = 5y

3x - 4y = 2000
4x - 5y = 2000

Multiply first by 5: 15x - 20y = 10000
Multiply second by 4: 16x - 20y = 8000
Subtract: x = 2000

Income A = 3 × 2000 = ₹6000
Income B = 4 × 2000 = ₹8000
**Answer: ₹6000 and ₹8000**

---

**HARD Example 6**: A mixture contains milk and water in ratio 5:3. If 8 liters of water is added, the ratio becomes 5:4. Find the quantity of milk.

**Solution**:
Let milk = 5x liters, water = 3x liters

After adding water:
5x/(3x+8) = 5/4
Cross multiply: 20x = 15x + 40
5x = 40
x = 8

Milk = 5 × 8 = 40 liters
**Answer: 40 liters**

### Short Tricks & Smart Methods

**Trick 1 - Ratio to Fraction**: 
a:b = a/b, so a:b = 3:4 means a is 3/7 of total and b is 4/7 of total

**Trick 2 - Making Ratios Equal**:
To find A:B:C when A:B and B:C are given, multiply to make B equal
Example: A:B = 2:3, B:C = 5:7
Make B = 15: A:B = 10:15, B:C = 15:21
So A:B:C = 10:15:21

**Trick 3 - Change in Ratio**:
If ratio changes from a:b to c:d after adding/subtracting x to both:
(a+x)/(b+x) = c/d, cross multiply and solve

**Trick 4 - Mean Proportion**:
Mean proportion between a and b = √(ab)

**Trick 5 - Third Proportion**:
If a:b::b:c, then c = b²/a (c is third proportional)

**Trick 6 - Fourth Proportion**:
If a:b::c:d, then d = bc/a (d is fourth proportional)

**Trick 7 - Quick Division**:
To divide N in ratio a:b:c
First part = [a/(a+b+c)] × N

**Trick 8 - Partnership Profit**:
Profit divides in ratio of (Capital × Time)

## TOPIC 4: PROFIT AND LOSS

### Question Types & Sub-types

1. **Basic Profit and Loss**
   - Finding profit/loss
   - Profit%/Loss%
   - Finding CP or SP
   
2. **Successive Discounts**
   - Two or more discounts
   - Finding single equivalent discount
   
3. **Marked Price Problems**
   - Discount on marked price
   - Profit after discount
   
4. **Dishonest Dealings**
   - False weights
   - Faulty measuring instruments
   
5. **Partnership & Profit Sharing**
   - Simple partnership
   - Time-based partnership

### Core Concepts

**Basic Terms**:
- **Cost Price (CP)**: Price at which article is purchased
- **Selling Price (SP)**: Price at which article is sold
- **Profit**: SP > CP; Profit = SP - CP
- **Loss**: CP > SP; Loss = CP - SP
- **Marked Price (MP)**: Price marked on article
- **Discount**: Reduction from marked price

**Key Formulas**:

1. **Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100**
2. **Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100**
3. **SP = CP × (100 + Profit%)/100**
4. **SP = CP × (100 - Loss%)/100**
5. **CP = SP × 100/(100 + Profit%)**
6. **CP = SP × 100/(100 - Loss%)**

**Marked Price and Discount**:
- **SP = MP - Discount**
- **SP = MP × (100 - Discount%)/100**
- **Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100**

**Successive Discounts**:
If two discounts are d₁% and d₂%:
Single equivalent discount = [d₁ + d₂ - (d₁×d₂)/100]%

**Important Results**:
- If SP is same for two articles, one at x% profit and other at x% loss, there is always a loss of (x²/100)%
- If CP is same for two articles, one sold at x% profit and other at x% loss, net profit/loss = 0

### Solved Examples

**EASY Example 1**: A book is bought for ₹250 and sold for ₹300. Find profit%.

**Solution**:
CP = ₹250, SP = ₹300
Profit = 300 - 250 = ₹50
Profit% = (50/250) × 100 = 20%
**Answer: 20%**

---

**EASY Example 2**: An article is sold at 15% profit. If CP is ₹400, find SP.

**Solution**:
SP = CP × (100 + Profit%)/100
SP = 400 × 115/100 = ₹460
**Answer: ₹460**

---

**MODERATE Example 3**: A shopkeeper marks his goods 40% above CP and gives 20% discount. Find his profit%.

**Solution**:
Let CP = 100
MP = 140
Discount = 20% of 140 = 28
SP = 140 - 28 = 112
Profit = 112 - 100 = 12
Profit% = 12%
**Answer: 12%**

---

**MODERATE Example 4**: Two successive discounts of 20% and 10% are equal to a single discount of?

**Solution**:
Using formula: d₁ + d₂ - (d₁×d₂)/100
= 20 + 10 - (20×10)/100
= 30 - 2 = 28%
**Answer: 28%**

---

**HARD Example 5**: A man sells two fans for ₹1980 each. On one he gains 10% and on the other he loses 10%. What is his overall profit or loss%?

**Solution**:
**Method 1**: When SP is same, there is always loss
Loss% = (10²/100)% = 1%

**Method 2**: Detailed calculation
For first fan (10% profit):
SP = 1980
CP₁ = 1980 × 100/110 = 1800

For second fan (10% loss):
SP = 1980
CP₂ = 1980 × 100/90 = 2200

Total CP = 1800 + 2200 = 4000
Total SP = 1980 + 1980 = 3960
Loss = 4000 - 3960 = 40
Loss% = (40/4000) × 100 = 1%

**Answer: 1% loss**

---

**HARD Example 6**: A dishonest dealer professes to sell at CP but uses a weight of 900 gm instead of 1 kg. Find his profit%.

**Solution**:
He gives 900 gm but charges for 1000 gm
CP of 900 gm = Let's say 900
SP (charged for 1 kg) = 1000
Profit = 1000 - 900 = 100
Profit% = (100/900) × 100 = 11.11%

**Answer: 11 1/9%** or 11.11%

---

**HARD Example 7**: A trader allows a discount of 15% on MP. Still he makes profit of 19%. If the article costs him ₹500, find the marked price.

**Solution**:
CP = 500
Profit% = 19%
SP = 500 × 119/100 = 595

SP = MP × (100-15)/100
595 = MP × 85/100
MP = 595 × 100/85 = 700
**Answer: ₹700**

### Short Tricks & Smart Methods

**Trick 1 - Quick CP/SP Formulas**:
- If profit% = x, then SP = CP × (100+x)/100
- If loss% = x, then SP = CP × (100-x)/100

**Trick 2 - Same SP, Different Profit/Loss**:
When two items sold at same SP, one at x% profit and other at x% loss:
Net result = Loss of (x²/100)%

**Trick 3 - Successive Discounts**:
For two discounts d₁% and d₂%:
Single discount = d₁ + d₂ - (d₁×d₂)/100

For three discounts: Apply above formula twice

**Trick 4 - Dishonest Dealer**:
Uses weight W instead of 1000 gm:
Profit% = [(1000-W)/W] × 100

**Trick 5 - MP and Discount**:
If MP is x% above CP and discount is y%:
Profit/Loss% = x - y - (xy/100)

**Trick 6 - Quick Check**:
Profit% or Loss% is always calculated on CP, never on SP

**Trick 7 - Percentage to Ratio**:
20% profit means SP:CP = 120:100 = 6:5
20% loss means SP:CP = 80:100 = 4:5

**Trick 8 - False Weights - Quick Formula**:
If claims x gm but gives y gm:
Profit% = [(x-y)/y] × 100

## TOPIC 5: TIME AND WORK, WORK AND WAGES

### Question Types & Sub-types

1. **Basic Time and Work**
   - Work done by one person/machine
   - Combined work by multiple entities
   - Work efficiency comparisons
   
2. **Pipes and Cisterns**
   - Filling pipes
   - Emptying pipes (outlets)
   - Combined filling/emptying
   
3. **Work and Wages**
   - Wage distribution based on work
   - Wage based on efficiency
   - Wage based on days worked
   
4. **Chain Rule / Man-Day Work**
   - MDH (Men-Days-Hours) problems
   - Comparing work scenarios

### Core Concepts

**Fundamental Principle**:
- If A can complete work in n days, A's 1 day work = 1/n
- Total Work is assumed as 1 (or LCM of all days for easier calculation)

**Key Formulas**:

1. **Work = Rate × Time**
2. **If A does work in x days and B in y days:**
   - Combined 1 day work = 1/x + 1/y
   - Together they complete in: xy/(x+y) days
   
3. **For Pipes:**
   - Inlet adds water (positive work)
   - Outlet removes water (negative work)
   - Net filling = Inlet rate - Outlet rate

4. **Efficiency and Time**:
   - Efficiency ∝ 1/Time
   - If A is twice as efficient as B, A takes half the time

5. **MDH Formula**:
   M₁D₁H₁/W₁ = M₂D₂H₂/W₂
   Where M=Men, D=Days, H=Hours per day, W=Work

### Solved Examples

**EASY Example 1**: A can complete a work in 12 days. In how many days will A complete half the work?

**Solution**:
A completes full work in 12 days
Half work will be completed in 12/2 = 6 days
**Answer: 6 days**

---

**EASY Example 2**: A can do work in 10 days, B in 15 days. Find their 1 day work when working together.

**Solution**:
A's 1 day work = 1/10
B's 1 day work = 1/15
Combined = 1/10 + 1/15 = 3/30 + 2/30 = 5/30 = 1/6
**Answer: 1/6 of work per day**

---

**MODERATE Example 3**: A can complete a work in 12 days and B in 18 days. They work together for 4 days, then B leaves. In how many more days will A complete the remaining work?

**Solution**:
A's 1 day work = 1/12
B's 1 day work = 1/18
Combined 1 day work = 1/12 + 1/18 = 3/36 + 2/36 = 5/36

Work done in 4 days = 4 × 5/36 = 20/36 = 5/9
Remaining work = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9

A completes 4/9 work in: (4/9) ÷ (1/12) = (4/9) × 12 = 48/9 = 5.33 days
**Answer: 5⅓ days or 5 days 8 hours**

---

**MODERATE Example 4**: A pipe can fill a tank in 6 hours. Another pipe can empty it in 8 hours. If both are opened together, in how much time will the tank be filled?

**Solution**:
Inlet (filling) rate = 1/6 per hour
Outlet (emptying) rate = 1/8 per hour
Net filling rate = 1/6 - 1/8 = 4/24 - 3/24 = 1/24 per hour

Time to fill = 24 hours
**Answer: 24 hours**

---

**HARD Example 5**: A and B can do a work in 12 days, B and C in 15 days, C and A in 20 days. How long will they take to complete the work together?

**Solution**:
A + B = 1/12 per day
B + C = 1/15 per day
C + A = 1/20 per day

Add all three:
2(A + B + C) = 1/12 + 1/15 + 1/20
= 5/60 + 4/60 + 3/60 = 12/60 = 1/5

A + B + C = 1/10 per day

Time = 10 days
**Answer: 10 days**

---

**HARD Example 6**: 12 men can complete a work in 18 days. After 6 days, 4 more men joined. In how many more days will the work be completed?

**Solution**:
Total work = 12 × 18 = 216 man-days

Work done in 6 days = 12 × 6 = 72 man-days
Remaining work = 216 - 72 = 144 man-days

Now 16 men are working:
Days required = 144/16 = 9 days
**Answer: 9 days**

---

**HARD Example 7**: A is 50% more efficient than B. If B can complete work in 30 days, in how many days can A and B together complete the work?

**Solution**:
B completes work in 30 days
A is 50% more efficient, so A completes in: 30 × (100/150) = 20 days

A's 1 day work = 1/20
B's 1 day work = 1/30
Combined = 1/20 + 1/30 = 3/60 + 2/60 = 5/60 = 1/12

**Answer: 12 days**

---

**HARD Example 8**: 10 men working 6 hours per day can complete a work in 12 days. How many men working 8 hours per day can complete the same work in 10 days?

**Solution**:
Using MDH formula: M₁D₁H₁ = M₂D₂H₂

10 × 12 × 6 = M₂ × 10 × 8
720 = M₂ × 80
M₂ = 9
**Answer: 9 men**

### Short Tricks & Smart Methods

**Trick 1 - LCM Method**:
When multiple people are involved, assume total work = LCM of all days
Example: A in 12 days, B in 15 days
Total work = LCM(12,15) = 60 units
A's rate = 60/12 = 5 units/day
B's rate = 60/15 = 4 units/day
Combined = 9 units/day
Time = 60/9 days

**Trick 2 - Together Formula**:
If A does in x days, B in y days
Together = xy/(x+y) days

**Trick 3 - Efficiency Ratio**:
If efficiency ratio = a:b, then time ratio = b:a (inverse)

**Trick 4 - Pipe Problems**:
Net rate = Sum of inlet rates - Sum of outlet rates

**Trick 5 - Work Distribution**:
Wages ∝ Work done ∝ (Efficiency × Time)

**Trick 6 - Percentage Efficiency**:
If A is x% more efficient than B:
A's time = B's time × [100/(100+x)]

**Trick 7 - Quick Check**:
Combined time is always less than individual minimum time

**Trick 8 - Man-Days**:
Total work in man-days = Men × Days
Constant for same work

### Practice Questions with Answers

**Answer**: 12 days [Using xy/(x+y) = 600/50 = 12]

**Q2.** A can do work in 15 days. He works for 10 days. What fraction of work is left?
**Answer**: 1/3 [Work done = 10/15 = 2/3; Left = 1/3]

**Q3.** A pipe fills tank in 4 hours, another empties in 6 hours. If both open, time to fill?
**Answer**: 12 hours [Net = 1/4 - 1/6 = 1/12]

**Q4.** A, B, C can do work in 10, 12, 15 days respectively. Working together, time required?
**Answer**: 4 days [1/10 + 1/12 + 1/15 = 1/4]

**Q5.** 8 men complete work in 12 days. How many men needed to complete in 8 days?
**Answer**: 12 men [8×12 = x×8; x = 12]

**Q6.** A is twice as efficient as B. If B completes work in 24 days, A takes?
**Answer**: 12 days [Half the time]

**Q7.** A, B together complete work in 12 days. A alone takes 20 days. B alone takes?
**Answer**: 30 days [1/20 + 1/B = 1/12; 1/B = 1/12 - 1/20 = 1/30]

**Q8.** 12 men working 8 hours/day complete work in 10 days. For same work in 8 days working 12 hours/day, men needed?
**Answer**: 10 men [12×8×10 = M×12×8; M = 10]

**Q9.** A can do 2/3 of work in 16 days. In how many days can A complete full work?
**Answer**: 24 days [If 2/3 in 16, then full in 16×3/2 = 24]

**Q10.** A completes 1/3 work in 5 days, B completes 2/5 of remaining work in 4 days. If they work together on remaining work, time needed?
**Answer**: 2 days [Remaining after A = 2/3; Remaining after B = 2/3 - 2/5×2/3 = 2/5; Together: A's rate = 1/15, B's rate = 1/15; Combined = 2/15; Time = (2/5)/(2/15) = 3 days... let me recalculate]

**Q10 Recalculation**: 
A does 1/3 in 5 days, so full work in 15 days (rate = 1/15)
After A, remaining = 2/3
B does 2/5 of 2/3 = 4/15 in 4 days (rate = 1/15)
Remaining work = 2/3 - 4/15 = 10/15 - 4/15 = 6/15 = 2/5
Together rate = 1/15 + 1/15 = 2/15
Time = (2/5)/(2/15) = 3 days
**Answer**: 3 days

## TOPIC 6: TIME AND DISTANCE

### Question Types & Sub-types

1. **Basic Speed-Distance-Time**
   - Converting units
   - Finding speed, distance, or time
   
2. **Average Speed**
   - Same distance different speeds
   - Different distances
   
3. **Relative Speed**
   - Same direction
   - Opposite direction
   
4. **Trains**
   - Crossing a pole/platform
   - Two trains crossing each other
   
5. **Boats and Streams**
   - Upstream and downstream
   - Still water speed
   
6. **Races**
   - Head start in time
   - Head start in distance

### Core Concepts

**Basic Formula**:
**Speed = Distance/Time**
**Distance = Speed × Time**
**Time = Distance/Speed**

**Unit Conversions**:
- 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s
- 1 m/s = 18/5 km/h
- To convert km/h to m/s: multiply by 5/18
- To convert m/s to km/h: multiply by 18/5

**Average Speed**:
- For same distance at speeds S₁ and S₂:
  Average Speed = (2S₁S₂)/(S₁+S₂) [Harmonic Mean]
- For different distances:
  Average Speed = Total Distance/Total Time

**Relative Speed**:
- Same direction: |S₁ - S₂|
- Opposite direction: S₁ + S₂

**Trains**:
- Crossing a pole/person: Distance = Length of train
- Crossing a platform: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform
- Two trains crossing: Distance = Sum of lengths

**Boats and Streams**:
- Downstream speed = Speed in still water + Stream speed
- Upstream speed = Speed in still water - Stream speed
- Speed in still water = (Downstream + Upstream)/2
- Stream speed = (Downstream - Upstream)/2

### Solved Examples

**EASY Example 1**: Convert 72 km/h to m/s.

**Solution**:
72 km/h = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s
**Answer: 20 m/s**

---

**EASY Example 2**: A car travels 180 km in 3 hours. Find its speed.

**Solution**:
Speed = Distance/Time = 180/3 = 60 km/h
**Answer: 60 km/h**

---

**MODERATE Example 3**: A person covers a certain distance at 40 km/h and returns at 60 km/h. Find average speed.

**Solution**:
Average speed = (2 × 40 × 60)/(40 + 60)
= 4800/100 = 48 km/h
**Answer: 48 km/h**

Note: NOT (40+60)/2 = 50!

---

**MODERATE Example 4**: Two trains of length 100m and 150m are running at 40 km/h and 50 km/h in opposite directions. In how much time will they cross each other?

**Solution**:
Relative speed = 40 + 50 = 90 km/h = 90 × 5/18 = 25 m/s
Total distance = 100 + 150 = 250m
Time = 250/25 = 10 seconds
**Answer: 10 seconds**

---

**HARD Example 5**: A boat can travel 30 km downstream in 2 hours and 18 km upstream in 3 hours. Find speed of boat in still water and speed of stream.

**Solution**:
Downstream speed = 30/2 = 15 km/h
Upstream speed = 18/3 = 6 km/h

Speed in still water = (15 + 6)/2 = 10.5 km/h
Stream speed = (15 - 6)/2 = 4.5 km/h

**Answer: Still water = 10.5 km/h, Stream = 4.5 km/h**

---

**HARD Example 6**: In a race of 1000m, A beats B by 100m or 10 seconds. Find A's speed.

**Solution**:
When A finishes 1000m, B has covered 900m
B covers remaining 100m in 10 seconds
B's speed = 100/10 = 10 m/s

Time taken by B to cover 900m = 900/10 = 90 seconds
This is same time A takes for 1000m
A's speed = 1000/90 = 11.11 m/s

**Answer: 11.11 m/s or 100/9 m/s**

---

**HARD Example 7**: A 150m long train crosses a platform in 15 seconds and a pole in 5 seconds. Find length of platform.

**Solution**:
Speed of train (crossing pole) = 150/5 = 30 m/s

When crossing platform:
Distance = Length of train + Length of platform
Let platform length = x
150 + x = 30 × 15
150 + x = 450
x = 300m

**Answer: 300m**

---

**HARD Example 8**: A and B start from same point. A moves north at 60 km/h and B moves east at 80 km/h. What is distance between them after 3 hours?

**Solution**:
After 3 hours:
A travels = 60 × 3 = 180 km north
B travels = 80 × 3 = 240 km east

Distance = √(180² + 240²)
= √(32400 + 57600)
= √90000 = 300 km

## TOPIC 7: ALLIGATION OR MIXTURE

### Question Types & Sub-types

1. **Basic Mixture**
   - Mixing two varieties
   - Finding mean price/concentration
   
2. **Alligation Method**
   - Finding ratio of mixing
   - Price-based problems
   
3. **Replacement**
   - Repeated replacement
   - Replacing part of mixture
   
4. **Concentration Problems**
   - Adding water to reduce concentration
   - Mixing different concentrations

### Core Concepts

**Alligation**: Method to find ratio in which ingredients at different prices must be mixed to get a mixture at given price.

**Alligation Rule**:
If two ingredients at prices P₁ and P₂ are mixed to get mean price M:

Ratio = (M - P₂):(P₁ - M)

**Visual Representation**:
```
        P₁              P₂
         \              /
          \            /
           \          /
            \        /
                M
           /        \
          /          \
       (M-P₂)      (P₁-M)
```

**Key Points**:
- P₁ should be greater price, P₂ lesser
- M should be between P₁ and P₂
- Ratio is calculated using cross-difference

**Replacement Formula**:
If a container has initial concentration C, and we replace fraction f each time for n times:
Final concentration = C(1-f)ⁿ

### Solved Examples

**EASY Example 1**: In what ratio must tea at ₹60/kg be mixed with tea at ₹65/kg to get mixture worth ₹62/kg?

**Solution**:

**MODERATE Example 2**: A milk vendor has 2 cans of milk. First contains 25% water and rest milk. Second contains 50% water. How much milk should he mix from each to get 12 liters of milk such that ratio of water to milk is 3:5?

**Solution**:
Water in mixture = 3/(3+5) = 3/8 = 37.5%

Using alligation between 25% and 50%:
```
     25%            50%
      \              /
       \            /
         37.5%
       /            \
      /              \
   (37.5-25)      (50-37.5)
     12.5           12.5
```
Ratio = 12.5:12.5 = 1:1

From each can = 6 liters
**Answer: 6 liters from each**

**MODERATE Example 3**: A vessel contains 60 liters of milk. 12 liters are removed and replaced with water. This process is repeated once more. Find final quantity of milk.

**Solution**:
**Method 1**: Step by step
After 1st operation: Milk = 60 - 12 = 48 liters
Concentration = 48/60 = 4/5

After 2nd operation:
Milk removed = 12 × 4/5 = 9.6 liters
Remaining milk = 48 - 9.6 = 38.4 liters

**Method 2**: Using formula
Fraction replaced each time = 12/60 = 1/5
After 2 operations: Milk = 60(1 - 1/5)² = 60 × (4/5)² = 60 × 16/25 = 38.4 liters

**Answer: 38.4 liters**

**HARD Example 4**: A dishonest milkman professes to sell milk at CP but mixes water. He gains 25%. Find ratio of water to milk in mixture.

**Solution**:
Let CP of pure milk = ₹100/liter
He sells mixture at ₹100 but gains 25%
So actual cost of mixture = 100/1.25 = ₹80/liter

Cost of water = ₹0
Cost of milk = ₹100

Using alligation:
```
      0             100
      \              /
       \            /
           80
       /            \
      /              \
     (80-0)       (100-80)
       80            20
```
Ratio of water:milk = 20:80 = 1:4
**Answer: 1:4**

**HARD Example 5**: Two vessels contain milk and water in ratios 2:3 and 4:1. In what ratio should they be mixed to get new mixture in which ratio of milk to water is 3:2?

**Solution**:
First vessel: Milk = 2/5 = 40%
Second vessel: Milk = 4/5 = 80%
Required mixture: Milk = 3/5 = 60%

Using alligation:
```
     40%            80%
      \              /
       \            /
          60%
       /            \
      /              \
   (60-40)        (80-60)
      20             20
```
Ratio = 1:1
**Answer: 1:1**

**HARD Example 6**: A container has 40 liters of wine. 8 liters is drawn out and replaced with water. This process is done 3 times. Find quantity of wine left.

**Solution**:
Fraction replaced = 8/40 = 1/5
After 3 operations:
Wine = 40(1 - 1/5)³
= 40 × (4/5)³
= 40 × 64/125
= 2560/125
= 20.48 liters

**Answer: 20.48 liters**

### Short Tricks & Smart Methods

**Trick 1 - Alligation Visual**:
Always draw the cross diagram:
```
   Cheaper        Dearer

         Mean
       /         \
      /           \
   Dearer-Mean  Mean-Cheaper
```
Ratio = (Dearer-Mean):(Mean-Cheaper)

**Trick 2 - Quick Ratio**:
For P₁, P₂, Mean M:
Ratio = (M-P₂):(P₁-M)

**Trick 3 - Replacement Formula**:
After n operations of replacing fraction f:
Final = Initial × (1-f)ⁿ

**Trick 4 - Percentage to Fraction**:
25% water means milk = 75% = 3/4
Convert percentages to fractions for easier calculation

**Trick 5 - Dishonest Dealer**:
If profit is x% by mixing water:
CP of mixture = CP of milk/(1 + x/100)
Then use alligation with water (cost 0)

**Trick 6 - Multiple Replacements**:
Don't calculate step by step, use formula (1-f)ⁿ

**Trick 7 - Milk-Water Ratio**:
If milk:water = a:b
Milk percentage = a/(a+b) × 100

**Trick 8 - Check Answer**:
Mean price must be between two prices

### Practice Questions with Answers

**SIMPLE INTEREST:**

**Q1.** Find SI on ₹1200 at 5% per annum for 4 years.
**Answer**: ₹240

**Q2.** At what rate will ₹3000 yield ₹900 as SI in 3 years?
**Answer**: 10% [R = (900×100)/(3000×3)]

**Q3.** In how many years will ₹2000 become ₹2800 at 8% SI?
**Answer**: 5 years [T = (800×100)/(2000×8)]

**Q4.** A sum becomes twice in 10 years at SI. Find rate.
**Answer**: 10% [R = 100/10]

**Q5.** SI on a sum for 5 years is ₹1000 and for 8 years is ₹1600. Find the sum.
**Answer**: ₹1000 [SI for 3 years = 600; For 1 year = 200; P×R = 20000; If SI for 5 years is 1000, P×R×5 = 100000, so P×R = 20000; This means for principal P, at rate R, 5 years SI = 1000, so (P×R×5)/100 = 1000, so P×R = 20000... need more info to find P]

Actually for Q5: Let me reconsider. SI for 5 years = 1000, for 8 years = 1600.
Difference = 600 for 3 years, so 1 year SI = 200.
Total SI for 5 years = 1000, so Principal × Rate = (1000 × 100)/5 = 20000.
But we need either P or R to find the other. The question seems incomplete.

Let me reframe: If SI increases from 1000 to 1600 in 3 years (from year 5 to 8), then yearly SI = 200.
So for 5 years, SI = 200 × 5 = 1000 ✓
Principal × Rate / 100 = 200
We can't find P without knowing R.

I'll skip exact calculation for Q5 and provide a different question:

**Q5 (Revised).** The difference between SI on a sum for 4 years and 6 years at 5% is ₹200. Find the sum.
**Answer**: ₹2000 [Difference in SI for 2 years = 200; Annual SI = 100; (P×5)/100 = 100; P = 2000]

**COMPOUND INTEREST:**

**Q6.** Find CI on ₹5000 for 2 years at 10% per annum.
**Answer**: ₹1050

**Q7.** At what rate will ₹4000 become ₹4410 in 2 years at CI?
**Answer**: 5% [4410 = 4000(1+R/100)²; 1.1025 = (1+R/100)²; 1.05 = 1+R/100; R = 5]

**Q8.** Find CI on ₹16000 for 9 months at 20% per annum compounded quarterly.
**Answer**: ₹2522 [Rate per quarter = 5%, Time = 3 quarters; A = 16000(1.05)³ = 16000×1.157625 = 18522; CI = 2522]

**Q9.** Difference between CI and SI on ₹10000 at 5% for 2 years is?
**Answer**: ₹25 [Using P(R/100)² = 10000×(5/100)² = 25]

**Q10.** A machine depreciates at 10% per annum. If present value is ₹100000, what was value 2 years ago?
**Answer**: ₹123456.79 approximately ₹123457 [100000 = P(0.9)²; P = 100000/0.81]

### Common Mistakes & Exam Tips

**SIMPLE INTEREST - Mistakes**:
1. Using 'Amount' instead of 'Principal' in formula
2. Not converting months to years or vice versa
3. Confusing Rate per annum with monthly rate
4. Calculating SI for each year separately instead of using formula once

**SIMPLE INTEREST - Tips**:
1. Always convert time to years (months/12, days/365)
2. Check if answer is Amount or just Interest
3. SI is same every year - use this to solve problems quickly
4. If sum doubles at SI in n years, rate = 100/n

**COMPOUND INTEREST - Mistakes**:
1. Forgetting to subtract P to get CI from Amount
2. Wrong calculation of half-yearly/quarterly periods
3. Using (R×n) instead of (1+R)ⁿ
4. Not adjusting rate and time for different compounding periods
5. Calculation errors in powers (especially (1.1)³, etc.)

**COMPOUND INTEREST - Tips**:
1. For 2 years: Use CI = P×R/100×(2 + R/100) for speed
2. Memorize common powers: (1.1)², (1.05)², (1.2)²
3. For half-yearly: R→R/2, T→2T (don't forget both!)
4. CI - SI for 2 years = P(R/100)² - Very useful shortcut
5. In growth/depreciation: increase → (1+R/100), decrease → (1-R/100)
6. Use calculator wisely: Round off at the end, not during calculation
7. Check answer: CI > SI for same period (except year 1)
8. For exam speed: If exact calculation tedious, use options to eliminate
9. Compound interest increases exponentially, not linearly
10. Practice mental calculation of (1.1)ⁿ for n = 2, 3, 4

## TOPIC 9: DATA INTERPRETATION & DATA SUFFICIENCY

### Question Types & Sub-types

**DATA INTERPRETATION (DI):**
1. **Tables** - Simple and complex
2. **Bar Graphs** - Simple, grouped, stacked
3. **Line Graphs** - Single and multiple lines
4. **Pie Charts** - Percentage distribution
5. **Mixed Graphs** - Combination of above
6. **Caselets** - Text-based data

**DATA SUFFICIENCY (DS):**
1. Two statements given - check if sufficient individually or combined
2. Standard format questions
3. Yes/No type questions

### Core Concepts

**DATA INTERPRETATION:**

**Approach**:
1. Read the question first, then look at data
2. Identify what's being asked
3. Extract relevant information only
4. Approximate when possible
5. Eliminate wrong options

**Common Calculations**:
- **Percentage**: (Part/Whole) × 100
- **Percentage Increase**: [(New-Old)/Old] × 100
- **Ratio**: Part₁:Part₂
- **Average**: Sum/Count
- **Growth Rate**: [(Final-Initial)/Initial] × 100

---

**DATA SUFFICIENCY:**

**Standard Options** (usually):
1. Statement I alone is sufficient
2. Statement II alone is sufficient
3. Either I or II alone is sufficient
4. Both I and II together are sufficient
5. Both together are not sufficient

**Approach**:
1. Read question carefully - identify what's asked
2. Check Statement I alone first
3. Then check Statement II alone
4. If neither alone, check both combined
5. Don't assume extra information

**Key Points**:
- Don't solve completely - just check if solvable
- Each statement should be considered independently first
- Common trap: Assuming information not given
