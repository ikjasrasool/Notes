# # **📌 1. Spring Boot Dependency Injection (DI)**

### Three ways of injecting dependencies:

### **1️⃣ Field Injection (Old – Not recommended)**

```java
@Autowired
private ProductService productService;
```

### ✔ Pros

* Easy to write

### ❌ Cons

* Hard to test
* No immutability

---

### **2️⃣ Setter Injection**

```java
private ProductService productService;

@Autowired
public void setProductService(ProductService productService) {
    this.productService = productService;
}
```

---

### **3️⃣ Constructor Injection (BEST PRACTICE)**

```java
private final ProductService productService;

public ProductController(ProductService productService) {
    this.productService = productService;
}
```

### ✔ Advantages

* Immutable dependencies
* Easy for unit testing
* Works perfectly with Lombok (`@RequiredArgsConstructor`)

---

# # **📌 2. Lombok Advanced Annotations**

| Annotation                 | Purpose                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@Getter`                  | Auto getter                                    |
| `@Setter`                  | Auto setter                                    |
| `@Data`                    | Getter + Setter + toString + equals + hashCode |
| `@NoArgsConstructor`       | Empty constructor                              |
| `@AllArgsConstructor`      | Constructor with all fields                    |
| `@Builder`                 | Builder design pattern                         |
| `@RequiredArgsConstructor` | Inject final fields automatically              |

---

## ⭐ Example using Lombok + Constructor Injection

```java
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class ProductService {
    private final ProductRepository productRepository;
}
```

---

# # **📌 3. Exception Handling in Spring Boot (VERY IMPORTANT)**

### Create a custom exception:

```java
public class ProductNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public ProductNotFoundException(String msg) {
        super(msg);
    }
}
```

---

### Global Exception Handler

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {

    @ExceptionHandler(ProductNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<?> handleException(ProductNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

---

### Advantage

* Clean controller
* Standard error format
* Reduces code duplication

---

# # **📌 4. DTO (Data Transfer Object)**

Used to send limited/custom data to the client.

### Example:

### **ProductDTO**

```java
@Data
public class ProductDTO {
    private String name;
    private double price;
}
```

---

### Convert Entity ↔ DTO using Mapper

```java
public class ProductMapper {
    public static ProductDTO toDTO(Product product) {
        ProductDTO dto = new ProductDTO();
        dto.setName(product.getName());
        dto.setPrice(product.getPrice());
        return dto;
    }
}
```

---

# # **📌 5. Spring Boot Mapper Libraries**

| Library     | Purpose                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------- |
| MapStruct   | Fast, compile-time mapping |
| ModelMapper | Runtime mapping            |

✔ MapStruct is recommended for large projects.

---

# # **📌 6. Spring Boot Security + JWT Authentication (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)**

---

# **🔥 Complete JWT Workflow**

### 1️⃣ User sends login request

`POST /auth/login`

```json
{
  "username": "ikjas",
  "password": "1234"
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Validate username & password

---

### 3️⃣ Generate JWT Token

A JWT contains:

```
Header + Payload + Signature
```

Example payload:

```json
{
  "sub": "ikjas",
  "roles": "ROLE_USER",
  "iat": 171205,
  "exp": 171505
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Return token to client

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsIn..."
}
```

---

### 5️⃣ Client stores token in:

✔ LocalStorage
✔ SessionStorage
✔ Cookies

Never store in React state.

---

### 6️⃣ For every API call, client sends token

```
Authorization: Bearer {token}
```

---

### 7️⃣ Backend validates token using Filter → Allows request

---

# **🔥 Benefits of JWT**

* Stateless
* No server-side sessions
* Fast authentication
* Works with microservices easily

---

# # **📌 7. Spring Boot Microservices (Very Important)**

### Key Components:

---

## **1️⃣ Eureka Server (Service Discovery)**

Stores microservice addresses
Example:

* Product-service
* Order-service
* Auth-service

---

## **2️⃣ API Gateway (Routing + Load Balancing)**

Examples:

* Spring Cloud Gateway
* Netflix Zuul

---

## **3️⃣ Config Server**

Centralized configuration store.

---

## **4️⃣ Circuit Breaker (Resilience)**

Using:

* Resilience4j
* Hystrix (old)

---

## **5️⃣ Feign Client**

Used to call another microservice easily.

### Example:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "order-service")
public interface OrderClient {

    @GetMapping("/order/{id}")
    OrderDTO getOrder(@PathVariable int id);
}
```

---

# # **📌 8. Spring Boot Actuator**

Used for:

* Health checks
* Metrics
* Monitoring
* Application info

Enable in `application.properties`:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

---

# # **📌 9. Caching in Spring Boot**

Use:

* `@EnableCaching`
* `@Cacheable`
* `@CacheEvict`

### Example:

```java
@Cacheable("products")
public List<Product> getAllProduct() {
    return productRepository.findAll();
}
```

---

# # **📌 10. Key Spring Boot Best Practices**

### ✔ Prefer constructor injection

### ✔ Use DTOs not entities in controller

### ✔ Use @Service for business logic

### ✔ Use @RestControllerAdvice for exception handling

### ✔ Never expose DB schema in API

### ✔ Use ResponseEntity<> everywhere

### ✔ Do validation using @Valid & @NotNull

### ✔ Use environment variables for DB password

### ✔ Avoid business logic in controllers
